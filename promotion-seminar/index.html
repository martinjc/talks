                    Research has demonstrated that active learning offers significant benefits to students over traditional passive delivery. These benefits can be realised with very simple adjustments to teaching style and planned activities. It is also possible to go further and remove the passive element from teaching contact time entirely. In this talk I will discuss some of the current research on teaching methods and student learning, and reflect on my personal experiences and experiments with flipped learning over the last five years.


                    Teaching Philosophy
                        Vince
                        Active Learning
                        FUCK Powerpoint - but it's easy to include active learning in a traditional lecture

                    "Students will remember more content if brief activities are introduced into the lecture"
                   
                    Collaborative and Cooperative learning facilitates better student learning than inidividual work (though individual work encouraging individual responsibility still matters)

                    PBL may not increase student performance but promotes better attitudes and study habits

                    Active learning is not the cure-all, but has significant benefits

                    Why lecture?

                    Quick, Cheap, Efficient - Delivery of Content rather than Facilitation of Learning

                    Have I drunk the Kool Aid? Yes
                    Would I like us to teach almost 100% flipped? Yes

                    Flipped learning
                        more time for students educational, emotional and social needs
                        more time with students =  better hearing about what they need 

                    Is it good for all students?
                        no - tails are still an issue and will require more or less support
                        but this is also true of 'traditional' methods

                    lecture capture causes poor attendance
                        No - poor engagement in lectures causes poor attendance
